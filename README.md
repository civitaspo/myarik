## Codenizable Resources
### `data_source`
* **name**: DataSource name (string, required)
* **type**: DataSource type (string, required)
* **options**: DataSource options (map, optional)
    * Configuable options depends on **type**.
        * You can see the options by `<your redash url>/api/data_sources/types`.
